* Key Behaviors to adjust settings
*/

// They key codes below can be used to adjust the TP settings at runtime
// without needing to recompile the firmware.
//
// The values will be logged and saved in the config on the controller flash
// after 60s (CONFIG_ZMK_SETTINGS_SAVE_DEBOUNCE).
//
// On boot the settings will be restored again.
//
// If you prefer a more explicit way of configuration, you can also hardcode
// these settings in `&mouse_ps2`.
//
// If you set these settings in `&mouse_ps2`, you will still be able to
// adjust the values during runtime with these key codes, but after
// restarting the board the values in `&mouse_ps2` will be restored and not
// the ones stored in the flash using the key codes.


// How sensitive the trackpoint is
#define U_MSS_TP_S_I &mms MS_TP_SENSITIVITY_INCR
#define U_MSS_TP_S_D &mms MS_TP_SENSITIVITY_DECR


// The maximum speed the trackpoint will accelerate to
#define U_MSS_TP_V6_I &mms MS_TP_VALUE6_INCR
#define U_MSS_TP_V6_D &mms MS_TP_VALUE6_DECR


// I am not quite sure tbh... default seems fine.
#define U_MSS_TP_NI_I &mms MS_TP_NEG_INERTIA_INCR
#define U_MSS_TP_NI_D &mms MS_TP_NEG_INERTIA_DECR


// How hard you have to press to activate the "Press To Select" feature that
// lets you tap or press on the trackpoint to click.
//
// Not all trackpoints support it and you have to enable
// `tp-press-to-select;` in `&mouse_ps2` first.
#define U_MSS_TP_PT_I &mms MS_TP_PTS_THRESHOLD_INCR
#define U_MSS_TP_PT_D &mms MS_TP_PTS_THRESHOLD_DECR


// If you mess up the settings, you can use this key code to clear the
// settings from flash and re-set the default values on the TP.
//
// Make sure to wait at least CONFIG_ZMK_SETTINGS_SAVE_DEBOUNCE seconds (60
// by default) before restarting the board to ensure the settings are
// written to flash storage.
#define U_MSS_RESET   &mms MS_RESET


// If you prefer to set the settings in `&mouse_ps2`, you can use the key
// codes above to find the settings you like the most and then press this
// key code to output the settings to the log.
//
// Then you can add those values to `&mouse_ps2`
#define U_MSS_LOG     &mms MS_LOG
